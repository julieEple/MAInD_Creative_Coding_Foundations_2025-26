Hello<3 Julie Alme´s first Creative Coding assignment wii!

Brief: 
Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:
    - is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop) - yep
    - allows the user to add and remove elements - yep
    - allows the user to coustomize elements (i.e. colors, size) - yep
    - allows the switch between two views (at least) - yep
